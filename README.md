This repository provides the MATLAB codes of the implementations for the PARAFAC Decomposition.

The algorithms proposed by Mr. Ming Shi will be placed in the corresponding subfolders, along with the original paper and maybe errata. 

All other algorithms and toolboxes will be placed in the 'dependency' subfolder. 

All test codes will be placed in the 'tests' subfolder.

All codes have been tested in MATLAB R2015b.

# How to use
Run 'install.m' in MATLAB. All codes will work properly after installation. 

# Limits
Please follow the Apache 2.0 License.

If these codes are helpful to your work, please cite the corresponding paper.

# Contact information
If you have any questions about the codes or the papers, please send email to mingshi13@fudan.edu.cn. 

For your convenience, please send your email using a business mailbox or gmail. Mails from other free mailboxes (e.g. 163.com, qq.com, ...) may be classified as trash or spam.

# History
2017.12.14 The codes of the ALS-MPPM algorithm and its test codes are uploaded.
