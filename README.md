This repository provides the MATLAB codes of the implementations for the PARAFAC Decomposition.</br>
The algorithms proposed by Mr. Ming Shi will be placed in the corresponding subfolders, along with the original paper and maybe errata. </br>
All other algorithms and toolboxes will be placed in the 'dependency' subfolder. </br>
All test codes will be placed in the 'tests' subfolder.</br>
All codes have been tested in MATLAB R2015b.

# How to use
Run 'install.m' in MATLAB. All codes will work properly after installation. 

# Citations
The codes and papers provided in thie repository are part of Mr. Shi's work toward his PhD degree. </br>
If any of these codes or papers is helpful to your work, please cite the following papers. </br>
